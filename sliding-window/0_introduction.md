# How to identify Sliding window problem
Problems mainly related to array or string and we were asked about some operation on subArray or subString
Need to find largest or smallest thing
Window Size is either given or we have to find out

# Type of Sliding window
1. Fixed size window
2. Variable size window : they asked for window size in program i.e. calculate largest window and smallest window


# fixed size Problems
1. Max min sub-array of size k
2. First negative in every min size of k
3. Count occurence of anagram
4. Maximum of all subarray of the size K
5. Max of min for every window size

# Variable Size Problem
1. Largest, smallest subarry [Sum K]
2. Largest sub-string K distinct characters
3. Length of largest substring without repeating characters
