/**
 * Quick sort
 * ? Identify a pivot element in the array
 *  - pick first element as pivot
 *  - pick last element as pivot
 *  - pick median element as pivot
 *  - pick random element as pivot
 * 
 * * 1. divide array into two parts, left and right except pivot
 * 
 * * 2. Put everything that is smaller than pivot into left array and 
 *      that which is greater than the pivot insert into a right array.
 * 
 * * 3. Repeat the process for the individual left and right arrays 
 *      till you have an array length 1, which is sorted by definition.
 * 
 * * 4. Repeatedly concatenate the left array, pivot and right array till one sorted array remains.
