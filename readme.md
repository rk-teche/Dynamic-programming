## Introduction

Dynamic programming and recursion are powerful problem-solving techniques widely used in computer science and software development. By breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems, these approaches enable the efficient computation of solutions. This repository aims to provide clear and comprehensive examples of dynamic programming and recursion to help developers grasp these techniques and apply them effectively.

## Dynamic Programming

The repository covers various dynamic programming concepts, including:

- Memoization
- Tabulation
- Optimal Substructure
- Overlapping Subproblems

Each concept is explained in detail, accompanied by code examples in multiple programming languages. Additionally, the repository includes explanations of dynamic programming algorithms such as the Fibonacci sequence, matrix chain multiplication, and the knapsack problem.

## Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental technique in computer programming that involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. The repository covers recursion topics such as:

- Recursive functions
- Base cases
- Recursive tree visualization
- Recursive backtracking

You will find examples of recursive algorithms like factorial computation, searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), and tree traversal algorithms (e.g., depth-first search).

## Examples

The repository provides practical examples demonstrating how dynamic programming and recursion can be applied to solve real-world problems. Each example includes a detailed README file explaining the problem statement, the approach using dynamic programming or recursion, and the corresponding code implementation. Examples are available in various programming languages to cater to different preferences.
