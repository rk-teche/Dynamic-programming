Make smaller input
Recursion - decision space
Recursion Tree - soul of recursion
2 steps to solve any recursive problem


Q: How to make input smaller?
A: We don't know how to make input smaller, so we need to make a decision and make input smaller.
    We take a decision and make input small   

Q: How to identify a problem is recursion problem or not?
A:
    Based on choices + Decision we make
    Recursive tree -> If you can design a recursive tree then code will be `cake walk`


Input-output method -
 output = initial_output + recursive_output
 input = initial_input + recursive_input


Recursion is everywhere -
- Array
- String
- Heap
- Stack
- Linklist
- Tree
- Graph (DFS, Flood fill)

Recusion Parts -
- Dynamic Programming
- BackTracking
- Divide and conquer

 
  
  Recusion 4 Approaches -
   1. Simple: Induction Base condition Hypothesis (IBH) -> very       useful in tree, linklist questions
   2. Medium:  Recursive Tree - I/P & O/P method
   3. Hard: Choice Diagram
   4.
